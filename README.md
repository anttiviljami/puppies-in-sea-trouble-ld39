# Trickle Game

The world runs a lighthouse, which runs on a mysterious substance called Ether.

Ships (with puppies in them) need to get ashore, but will sink in the deadly
waters unless the lighthouse is lit at all times.

## Notes

- The lighthouse is kept alive by pushing a button, which expends Ether
- Each button press charges up the lighthouse +2 seconds (drains 0.00005 ETH)
- 20 seconds without pressing the button will result in the lighthouse going dark (puppies will die)
- Day / Night cycle ?
